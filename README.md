Developer Playground
======================

Win32 API and COM hooking/tracing.

Introduction
------------

The idea of Developer Playground is simple: Allow hooking of arbitrary processes and tracing of every call to any DLL, without the overhead of a debugger. We feel that this utility is a great help in tracing program flow without access to source code or debug symbols; and without having to resort to assembly-level debugging. We hope you'll find it useful.
